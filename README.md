# Javascript-Password Generator

## Description

This is a project where I was given the index.html and style.css files for a basic website that will generate a randomized password. The main purpose was to demonstrate understanding of how to use Javascript (variables, functions).

I had to create multiple prompts/confirm messages for the user to input what they wanted their password to include. The site first prompts for the password length, then asks if the user wants uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters to be included.

This project required creating multiple functions. I had to create a function for the generator to select randomly from all lowercase letters, and then repeat this for uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. For most of these I used fromCharCode rather than from a string or array.

A separate function was then made to select from the kinds of characters selected by the user, which then randomizes and selects characters based on the length that the user chose and on the confirm messages.

This information is then passed into the text box above the generate button, giving the user their password.
